Pune House Price Prediction using Machine Learning, Web Scraping & Streamlit

This project predicts housing prices in Pune using a Linear Regression model, trained on real-world housing listings scraped from Quikr.com. It includes a clean and user-friendly Streamlit interface that allows users to input property details (location, area, BHK, bathrooms) and receive real-time price predictions.

The project demonstrates the full machine learning lifecycle:

🔍 Web scraping using BeautifulSoup to collect real estate data

🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing

🧠 Model training with scikit-learn

💾 Model persistence with joblib

🌐 Frontend deployment using Streamlit
